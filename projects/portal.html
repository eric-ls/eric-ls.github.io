      <h1 class="h1 margin-bottom--lg">Web Design Decal Student Portal</h1>
      <h2 class="h2 margin-bottom--xxl">This summer, I started design and development on an online portal for students taking the class I teach, the <a href="http://wdd.io" target="_blank" class="link">Web Design Decal (WDD)</a>.</h2>


      <h2 class="h2" style="padding-top: 30px;">Problem</h2>
      <p class="p-em margin-bottom--lg">How do we enable WDD students to quickly and easily access course material?</p>

      <p>The current class management system we were using, <a href="https://www.canvaslms.com/higher-education/" class="link" target="_blank">Canvas</a>, was bloated, difficult to use, and slow. We weren't using many features, and simply needed a platform to distribute lecture schedules, show homework assignments, and allow submissions.</p>

      <p>Here's a screenshot of the University software:</p>
      <div class="img-container margin-bottom--xxl"><img src="../assets/images/portal/bcourses.png" alt=""></div>

      <p>There were a couple of things that didn't work out for our class specifically. The Canvas software was:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Physically slow to load</li>
        <li>Interface isnâ€™t very intuitive - takes long time to develop mental model</li>
        <li>Accessing relevant lecture material is difficult</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="margin-top--lg">One of the main goals I kept on my mind was to design an interface that students could spend the <strong>least</strong> amount of time on.<strong> Less time spent on our website during lecture = more time learning!</strong></p>

      <h2 class="h2" style="padding-top: 70px;">Hypothesis</h2>
      <p class="p-em">A clean and fast course website that doesn't distract students from learning course material.</p>
      <h3 class="h3">Goals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Quick access of relevant class material, like lecture slides, assignments, and studio activities</li>
        <li>Easy upload and preview of assignment submission</li>
        <li>Keeping track of logistics like grades and attendance</li>
        <li>Not be a barrier to learning!</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="h2 margin-top--xxl">Research</h2>
      <p>From the previous semesters teaching the course, I already had a guess for the main audience of our site:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>students uploading homework on due dates</li>
        <li>students accessing class slides + activities during lecture</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="margin-top--lg">As it stood, our lectures occurred on Thursdays, and I was able to validate my hypothesis using Google Analytics. The spikes below correspond to weekly lecture dates:</p>

      <div class="img-container margin-top--xxl margin-bottom--xxl"><img src="../assets/images/portal/analytics.png" alt=""></div>

      <p>Since many of my friends also enrolled in my course previously, I conducted some interviews and further validated the two main use cases above.</p>

      <h2 class="h2 margin-top--xxl">Design</h2>
      <p>I started with some sketches to draft basic page design, then moved to Sketch to finish the visual designs.</p>
      <div class="img-container"><img src="../assets/images/portal/portal-sketch.jpg" alt=""></div>
      <h2 class="h2 margin-top--xxl margin-bottom--sm">The homepage</h2>
      <div class="img-container"><img src="../assets/images/portal/s-1.jpg" alt=""></div>
      <h2 class="h2 margin-top--xxl margin-bottom--sm">Class schedule</h2>
      <div class="img-container"><img src="../assets/images/portal/s-2.png" alt=""></div>
      <h2 class="h2 margin-top--xxl margin-bottom--sm">Student Dashboard (Iteration 1)</h2>
      <div class="img-container"><img src="../assets/images/portal/s-3.png" alt=""></div>
      <h2 class="h2 margin-top--xxl margin-bottom--sm">Student Dashboard (Iteration 2)</h2>
      <div class="img-container"><img src="../assets/images/portal/s-4.png" alt=""></div>
      <h2 class="h2 margin-top--xxl margin-bottom--sm">Assignment Page</h2>
      <div class="img-container"><img src="../assets/images/portal/s-5.png" alt=""></div>
      <h2 class="h2 margin-top--xxl">Prototyping</h2>
      <p>Most of the views in this project were pretty straightforward, but I did prototype one of the key interactions: student assignment submission. I prototyped in PrincipleJS, video below!</p>
      <video class="img-container" width="100%" controls loop>
        <source src="../assets/images/portal/prototype.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      </video>

      <h2 class="h2 margin-top--xxl">Conclusion</h2>
      <p class="margin-bottom--xxl">I'm currently working on implementing the Portal in React / Rails, but also iterating on the design. After our first class this week (September 8), I hope to conduct some formal tests on my students this semester.</p>
